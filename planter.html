                            <p class="description-body">
                                We started our journey to create the self-watering planter when we partnered with Hudson Guild, a senior center just a few blocks away from our school. After talking to the seniors, we realized that many of them enjoy gardening as much as we do. However, we also realized that many of them do not come to the community center every day, so they couldn't consistently water their plants. We wanted to help the seniors enjoy gardening more easily, so we created the self-watering planter. The self-watering planter uses a sub-irrigation system to water the plants automatically. This means that the seniors don't have to worry about watering their plants every day.

                                How it works
                            </h2>
                            <p class="description-body">
                                The self-watering planter has three semi-corrugated pipes running below the soil. These pipes hold water, which is accessible through an access pipe in the corner of the planter. When the soil gets dry, the water automatically flows out of the tiny holes in the pipes and moistens the soil. The roots of the plants will then absorb the water. When the water runs out, the planter can be refilled. We hope that the self-watering planter will make gardening more accessible to seniors and other people who have difficulty watering their plants. We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of gardening, regardless of their circumstances.
