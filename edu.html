                                We decided to create an educational version of the Baby Sprout aimed at elementary school students in light of the pandemic and our experiences in taking classes online. After meeting with teachers in Avenues's Lower Division, we realized that our negative experience was ubiquitous and exacerbated in the case of education for younger students. Sitting behind a screen all day, kindergartener through third graders alike were missing out on the opportunity to move around and learn kinetically. In the spring of 2021, we introduced a few of our first edition Baby Sprout gardening kits to a class of first graders who had spend almost a full academic year social distancing and taking classes online. They were a hit! Soon after, we continued working with Avenues classes to modify the Baby Sprout into a tool that was fun and engaging to work with for students and satisfied the curricula requirements of teachers.
